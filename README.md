## PicEmbedder - Embed any file into uncompiled AHK v2 scripts
### Download v1: [`SCRIPT`](https://github.com/DavidBevi/PicEmbedder/releases/download/v1/pic_embedder_v1.ahk) | [`COMPILED`](https://github.com/DavidBevi/PicEmbedder/releases/download/v1/pic_embedder_v1.exe)

I wanted to share a script with a custom tray icon **without** having to also share a separate image file. 

This is my third solution, it produces the **most compact** code and it offers a **guided procedure** to do it.
