# [PicEmbedder](https://github.com/DavidBevi/PicEmbedder/blob/main/pic_embedder_v1.ahk)<sup> old</sup> â†’ [FileEmbedder](https://github.com/DavidBevi/PicEmbedder/blob/main/file_embedder_v2.ahk)<sup> new</sup>
### Embed files into uncompiled AHK v2 scripts

- **old** - was already capable of encoding any file in a string but designed to only accept pictures.
- **new** - removes the arbitrary limit, therefore the script is renamed.
- **todo** - rework this page, possibly open a new repo.

<br/>

### Credits

This script is inspired by [iPhilip's port of JustMe's **image2include**](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=119966) and by [EpicKeyboardGuy's **Embed ANY files into your script**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoHotkey/comments/1ina2y7/embed_any_files_into_your_script/).

My script produces a **more compact** code and it offers a **guided procedure** to do encoding and embedding.

### Old demo (v2 will come ASAP)
