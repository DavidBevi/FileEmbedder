This script is inspired by [iPhilip's port of JustMe's **image2include**](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=119966) and by [EpicKeyboardGuy's **Embed ANY files into your script**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoHotkey/comments/1ina2y7/embed_any_files_into_your_script/).

My script produces a **more compact** code and it offers a **guided procedure** to do encoding and embedding.
